		<H1>ary Flory Consulting Website Tranfer WordPress -> WIX</H1>
		<h2>Overview (Scope of Work)</h2>
		<p>G.A. Flory consulting, a global consulting firm, helps clients with a range of services including animal disease and natural disaster response, agricultural emergency planning, and emergency response. He would like his website content transferred within his WordPress site to a more professional consulting Wix themed website with a whole new platform for branding.</p>
		
		<h3>Audience (personas)</h3>
		<p>His Clients include government agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an international organization such as the food and Agriculture Agencies of the United Nations and the World Organization for Animal Health, and commercial swine and poultry companies.</p>
		
		<h4>Goals (including issues related to Technically Wrong)</h4>
		<p>I  am working on a design strategy role for Gary's site, I believe he wants to run some things by Gary (aesthetic in general, Phil's logo drafts, colors, and Gary's priorities for navigation and layout), that should get us into a position to define the design strategy so that you can start site work.</p>
		<p>There are a lot of functions and ways one can display content for this theme. With my topic and content being relatively simple and more informative, I need a theme to focus on the main topics and points. I like the layout of the homepage, but if I used this theme, I would have to be concerned about breaking up each content displacement, allowing it not to be cluttered and overcrowded with information.</p>


		<p> Gary Flory wants his site...</p>

		<li>remodels wbsite</li>

<H1>Joseph Alejandro Devine's Portfolio-> WIX</H1>
<h2>Overview (Scope of Work)</h2>
<p>I would like to organize and gather all my professional and academic portfolio pieces to showcase my work in a platform that is not only professional but creative for future employers to explore</p>

<h3>Audience (personas)</h3>
<p>I am making this portfolio WIX site for future employees to all in one place see my achievements, skills, languages, and portfolio works I have created over the years during my undergrad SMAD and professional. I also have obtained Clients working for JMU BIZLab and would like to show my future clientele what kinds of projects I have worked with and if I can similarly assist them.</p>	
	
<h4>Goals (including issues related to Technically Wrong)</h4>
	
	<p>I decided to use this webpage-theme, because I felt that it was the most effective and representational template I could display my portfolio pieces, in a way that is navigable and easily identifiable. I like how the simple format allows the user to not only have access to each section of information on the homepage but as well in the header bar. The limited data sections and format separation on the homepage, allows one to focus on which is being displayed instead of each section, that the user will not pay attention too. However, I felt that this theme was the perfect example to addresses good user experience design. This theme provides customization options, a nice picture at the top of the screen that is not too massive, and an easily readable headline and navigation bar.</p>
	
		<<p>This template might be harder to navigate compared with the other themes. It is a simple design that might be unattractive to viewers using the site. There’s not a lot of details or functionality on the homepage. The layout is pretty straight forward allowing rows to display content instead of pictures. Even though this theme’s layout is bare with minimum sections, I can fully empathize and center the important content that the viewer is taking and scanning on the web page. </p>

		<p>I like how each section/content on the homepage is broken up, making it look simple, organized, and easily navigable. The users can click on each section “the picture boxes”, where they want to go. This theme is more for users to get a visual, effectively directing where the user should go for information-making a great example of information hierarchy and addresses good user experience design.</p>
